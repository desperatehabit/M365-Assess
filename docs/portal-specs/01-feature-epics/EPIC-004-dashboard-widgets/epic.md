# EPIC-004 — Dashboard & Widgets

## Report

Per-tenant and all-tenant dashboards with configurable widgets (score, MFA, licenses, alerts).

Full functional specification: `docs/portal-specs/01-feature-epics/EPIC-004-dashboard-widgets/SPEC.md`.

Cluster: Platform. CIPP provenance: cipp-features.md #47; cipp-ui-patterns §6.

This is an epic rollup. It is **never dispatched** by the fleet tool; its children carry the
code. Children are authored into `ISSUES/` (`T-NNNN.md`) once SPEC.md §3-§6 fix the file layout
and real `scope:` paths can be named.

## Acceptance

- [ ] SPEC.md sections 2-9 complete and approved.
- [ ] Child tickets authored in `tickets/` with non-empty `scope:`.
- [ ] All children closed before this epic is considered done.
