# EPIC-002 — Tenants & Onboarding

## Report

Manage the tenant list, credentials, groups, variables, and both direct and GDAP onboarding paths.

Full functional specification: `docs/portal-specs/01-feature-epics/EPIC-002-tenants-onboarding/SPEC.md`.

Cluster: Platform. CIPP provenance: cipp-features.md #1-#5; 03-database §3-4.

This is an epic rollup. It is **never dispatched** by the fleet tool; its children carry the
code. Children are authored into `ISSUES/` with `parent: "EPIC-002"` once SPEC.md §3-§6 fix the
file layout and real `scope:` paths can be named.

## Acceptance

- [x] SPEC.md sections 2-9 complete and approved.
- [x] Child tickets authored in `tickets/` with non-empty `scope:`.
- [x] All children closed before this epic is considered done.
