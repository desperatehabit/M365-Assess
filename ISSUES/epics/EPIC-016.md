# EPIC-016 — Intune Policies

## Report

Intune config/compliance/app-protection policies, templates, reusable settings, assignment filters, and comparison.

Full functional specification: `docs/portal-specs/01-feature-epics/EPIC-016-intune-policies/SPEC.md`.

Cluster: Devices. CIPP provenance: cipp-features.md #12.

This is an epic rollup. It is **never dispatched** by the fleet tool; its children carry the
code. Children are authored directly into `ISSUES/` with `parent: "EPIC-016"`; the `children:`
list above names them in dependency order.

## Acceptance

- [ ] SPEC.md sections 2-9 complete and approved.
- [ ] Child tickets authored in `tickets/` with non-empty `scope:`.
- [ ] All children closed before this epic is considered done.
