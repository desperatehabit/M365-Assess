# EPIC-005 — Executive/PDF Reports & Report Builder

## Report

Branded executive PDF/HTML reports and a drag-in-blocks report builder with templates and scheduling.

Full functional specification: `docs/portal-specs/01-feature-epics/EPIC-005-executive-reports/SPEC.md`.

Cluster: Platform. CIPP provenance: cipp-features.md #48; cipp-ui-patterns §8.

This is an epic rollup. It is **never dispatched** by the fleet tool; its children carry the
code. Children are authored into `ISSUES/` (`T-NNNN.md`) once SPEC.md §3-§6 fix the file layout
and real `scope:` paths can be named.

## Acceptance

- [x] SPEC.md sections 2-9 complete and approved.
- [x] Child tickets authored in `tickets/` with non-empty `scope:`.
- [x] All children closed before this epic is considered done.
