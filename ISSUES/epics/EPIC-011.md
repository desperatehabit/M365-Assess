# EPIC-011 — Users & Offboarding

## Report

User lifecycle: create/edit/bulk/patch, templates, disable, BEC remediation, and the offboarding wizard.

Full functional specification: `docs/portal-specs/01-feature-epics/EPIC-011-users-offboarding/SPEC.md`.

Cluster: Identity. CIPP provenance: cipp-features.md #22,#25,#28,#54.

This is an epic rollup. It is **never dispatched** by the fleet tool; its children carry the
code. Children are authored into `ISSUES/` and name real `scope:` paths from SPEC.md §3-§8.

## Acceptance

- [ ] SPEC.md sections 2-9 complete and approved.
- [ ] Child tickets authored in `tickets/` with non-empty `scope:`.
- [ ] All children closed before this epic is considered done.
