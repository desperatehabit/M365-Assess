# EPIC-007 — Scheduler & Custom Scripts

## Report

Cron scheduling for runs/standards/reports, plus sandboxed custom PowerShell scripts.

Full functional specification: `docs/portal-specs/01-feature-epics/EPIC-007-scheduler-custom-scripts/SPEC.md`.

Cluster: Platform. CIPP provenance: cipp-features.md #49-#50.

This is an epic rollup. It is **never dispatched** by the fleet tool; its children carry the
code. Children are authored into `ISSUES/` (`T-NNNN.md`) once SPEC.md §3-§6 fix the file layout
and real `scope:` paths can be named.

## Acceptance

- [ ] SPEC.md sections 2-9 complete and approved.
- [ ] Child tickets authored in `tickets/` with non-empty `scope:`.
- [ ] All children closed before this epic is considered done.
