# EPIC-006 — Remediation Engine

## Report

Plan-only remediation for all checks, then gated apply with audit — the write path for the whole product.

Full functional specification: `docs/portal-specs/01-feature-epics/EPIC-006-remediation-engine/SPEC.md`.

Cluster: Platform. CIPP provenance: cipp-features.md #6 (remediate flags); 06-remediation.md; 02-controls/.

This is an epic rollup. It is **never dispatched** by the fleet tool; its children carry the
code. Children are authored directly into `ISSUES/` with `parent: "EPIC-006"`; the `children:`
list above names them in dependency order.

## Acceptance

- [ ] SPEC.md sections 2-9 complete and approved.
- [ ] Child tickets authored in `tickets/` with non-empty `scope:`.
- [ ] All children closed before this epic is considered done.
