# EPIC-010 — Baselines & Rollouts

## Report

Staged rollouts of standards with fleet overview, stage progress, history, and trend.

Full functional specification: `docs/portal-specs/01-feature-epics/EPIC-010-baselines-rollouts/SPEC.md`.

Cluster: Standards. CIPP provenance: cipp-features.md #8; cipp-standards-ux §7.

This is an epic rollup. It is **never dispatched** by the fleet tool; its children carry the
code. Children are authored directly into `ISSUES/` once SPEC.md §3-§6 fix the file layout and
real `scope:` paths can be named.

## Acceptance

- [ ] SPEC.md sections 2-9 complete and approved.
- [ ] Child tickets authored in `tickets/` with non-empty `scope:`.
- [ ] All children closed before this epic is considered done.
