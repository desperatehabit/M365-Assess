# EPIC-003 — Assessment Runs & Queue

## Report

Trigger, queue, execute, and track assessment runs across many tenants, surfacing progress.

Full functional specification: `docs/portal-specs/01-feature-epics/EPIC-003-assessment-runs/SPEC.md`.

Cluster: Platform. CIPP provenance: cipp-features.md #49; 01-architecture §3.

This is an epic rollup. It is **never dispatched** by the fleet tool; its children carry the
code. Children are authored into `ISSUES/` with `parent: "EPIC-003"` once SPEC.md §3-§6 fix the
file layout and real `scope:` paths can be named.

## Acceptance

- [ ] SPEC.md sections 2-9 complete and approved.
- [ ] Child tickets authored in `tickets/` with non-empty `scope:`.
- [ ] All children closed before this epic is considered done.
