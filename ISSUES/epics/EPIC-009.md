# EPIC-009 — Drift Management

## Report

Full desired-state comparison per tenant with deviation triage (accept / customer-specific / deny).

Full functional specification: `docs/portal-specs/01-feature-epics/EPIC-009-drift-management/SPEC.md`.

Cluster: Standards. CIPP provenance: cipp-features.md #7; cipp-standards-ux §4-6.

This is an epic rollup. It is **never dispatched** by the fleet tool; its children carry the
code. Children are authored directly into `ISSUES/` once SPEC.md §3-§6 fix the file layout and
real `scope:` paths can be named.

## Acceptance

- [ ] SPEC.md sections 2-9 complete and approved.
- [ ] Child tickets authored in `tickets/` with non-empty `scope:`.
- [ ] All children closed before this epic is considered done.
