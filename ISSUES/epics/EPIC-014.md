# EPIC-014 — Groups

## Report

Group lifecycle, templates, bulk membership, licensing, hide-from-GAL, delivery management.

Full functional specification: `docs/portal-specs/01-feature-epics/EPIC-014-groups/SPEC.md`.

Cluster: Identity. CIPP provenance: cipp-features.md #26.

This is an epic rollup. It is **never dispatched** by the fleet tool; its children carry the
code. Children are authored directly into `ISSUES/` with `parent: "EPIC-014"`; the `children:`
list above names them in dependency order.

## Acceptance

- [ ] SPEC.md sections 2-9 complete and approved.
- [ ] Child tickets authored in `tickets/` with non-empty `scope:`.
- [ ] All children closed before this epic is considered done.
