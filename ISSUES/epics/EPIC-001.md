# EPIC-001 — Platform Foundation

## Report

Make the module safe to run concurrently per tenant and stand up the service skeleton (API, storage, auth, job queue) so every later epic has a foundation.

Full functional specification: `docs/portal-specs/01-feature-epics/EPIC-001-platform-foundation/SPEC.md`.

Cluster: Platform. CIPP provenance: cipp-features.md §0 (router/auth/storage); 01-architecture.md §4.

This is an epic rollup. It is **never dispatched** by the fleet tool; its children carry the
code. Children are authored into `ISSUES/` with non-empty `scope:` paths named against the
layout in SPEC.md §1.

## Acceptance

- [ ] SPEC.md sections 2-9 complete and approved.
- [ ] Child tickets authored in `tickets/` with non-empty `scope:`.
- [ ] All children closed before this epic is considered done.
