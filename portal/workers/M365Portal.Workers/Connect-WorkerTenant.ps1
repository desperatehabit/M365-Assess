# Connect-WorkerTenant.ps1 - feature worker tenant sign-in (T-0826).
#
# Feature workers run in their own pwsh child and call Microsoft Graph (and, for a few,
# Exchange Online) against one tenant. The BFF puts a `credential` block in the job file:
# the credential reference and the non-secret credential row, never material. This
# resolves it inside the child with Resolve-TenantCredential (T-0011), connects each
# requested service through the module's Common/Connect-Service.ps1, and returns a session
# that Disconnect-WorkerTenant closes. Errors are coded (worker.credential_*,
# worker.connect_failed) and scrubbed of secret material.

function Connect-WorkerTenant {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Signs a feature worker in to its tenant from the job file's credential block.
    .DESCRIPTION
        Resolves the credential inside this process, connects each service in order, and
        returns a session for Disconnect-WorkerTenant. If a later service fails, services
        already connected are disconnected before the error is thrown.
    .PARAMETER JobFile
        Path to the job envelope JSON (tenantId plus credential { credentialRef, record }).
    .PARAMETER Service
        Services to connect: Graph (default) and/or ExchangeOnline.
    .PARAMETER CredentialStore
        Secret lookup for client-secret and PFX credentials (T-0827). Certificate-thumbprint
        credentials need none.
    .PARAMETER ConnectScript
        Path to Connect-Service.ps1; defaults to the module's copy. Tests pass a stub.
